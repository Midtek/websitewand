javascript website wand
eliminate that pesky 'reading'

Peter Mills created the website wand to eliminate the hastles of a browser and the difficulty of reading. The website wand is for users who need their experience to be simplified and universal.

This project was created as a means for Peter to learn JavaScript and Github interface/workflow.

Thanks for your interest!
